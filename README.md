# 🎮 iPSX2 – A PS2 Emulator for iOS with JIT (Ported from PCSX2 / ARMSX2)

This project brings PCSX2 and ARMSX2 to iOS devices.
The porting process was done using fully AI-assisted coding.

## 🛠️ Compatibility

    Confirmed working on iOS 26 and iOS 18 via StikDebug & UTM-Dolphin.js

## 📦 Building an Unsigned IPA

This repository leverages a fully automated headless GitHub Actions pipeline to compile the C++ and Swift bridging components with CMake into a raw unsigned `.ipa`.

To build your own installer package:

1. Fork or push changes to your `main` branch.
2. Navigate to your repository's **Actions** tab.
3. Select the **Build Unsigned iPSX2.ipa** workflow and click **Run workflow**.
4. Once completed, download the `iPSX2-unsigned` artifact ZIP at the bottom of the workflow summary.
5. Extract the `.ipa` file and sideload it to your device using your preferred signing tool (e.g., AltStore, TrollStore, Sideloadly).

## 🚀 New Features

- Useful for debugging, diagnostics, and remote support.

### 🌑 Dark Theme

### 🌐 OTA GameIndex Updates

- Game compatibility database (GameIndex.yaml) can be updated over-the-air (OTA) without reinstalling the app.
- Ensures you always have the latest game fixes and compatibility tweaks.

## 📱 Platform Support

- Fully compatible with **iOS 26** and newer.
- Works on both jailbroken and non-jailbroken devices (with JIT via recommended stack).
